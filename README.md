# Hexagonal Architecture in Java

[![CI](https://github.com/newmancodes/java-hexagonal-architecture/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/newmancodes/java-hexagonal-architecture/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Used [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to create the project, selecting the following options:

- Project: Maven
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: 4.0.3
- Packaging: Jar
- Configuration: YAML
- Java: 25

And these dependencies:

- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Validation
- Spring Boot Activator
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Testcontainers
- Lombok

Definitely leaning on both Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Code a fair bit on this one. This is a simple project for
educational purposes, experimenting with Hexagonal Architecture in Java.
